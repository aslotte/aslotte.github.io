In my previous [post](https://www.alexanderslotte.com/5-reasons-why-you-as-a-net-developer-should-venture-into-machine-learning-today/) I talked about some reasons why I think developers should venture into machine learning today. In this post I want to look at it from a different perspective and explore some reasons small to mid-size organizations could benefit from starting their journey. 



\- Why organizations with existing .NET teams should invest in ML in .NET

\- Level up your development team

\- New business opportunities and source of revenue

\- The cost of doing business is much less than what it used to be

\- What's a good use case of ML? Where does organization use it when they shouldn't

\- How do I know if my organization is ready for ML? How do I know that I have the data I need

\- How do I combat bias and build in explainability from the beginning?
