It's with great pleasure I announce the release v1.2 of MLOps.NET! The library has come a long way since the first code file was committed in May. We each submitted PR, we inch forward towards a complete end-to-end MLOps solution for ML.NET.

\## What is MLOps.NET?

MLOps.NET is a data science tool designed to manage and handle the machine learning lifecycle for a model trained in ML.NET. MLOps as a practice has over the last year quickly emerged as a vital instrument to successfully deploy machine learning models to production, while keeping track of how they were trained, what data they were trained on and much more.
